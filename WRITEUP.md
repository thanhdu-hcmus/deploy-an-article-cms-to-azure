### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

After evaluating deployment options for the CMS app, I chose Azure App Service due to its advantages in scalability, ease of management, and cost-effectiveness. App Service offers built-in scaling capabilities and automated updates, allowing the development team to focus on enhancing the application rather than managing infrastructure. Its seamless integration with other Azure services also streamlines workflows, making it an ideal choice for rapid development and deployment.

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

If the app's requirements shifted to necessitate more control over the underlying infrastructure—such as specific OS configurations or regulatory compliance—then I would reconsider using VMs. Additionally, if the app needed extensive customization that exceeded the capabilities of App Service, that would also prompt a switch to a VM solution.
